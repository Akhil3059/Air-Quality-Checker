# Air-Quality-Checker
Air Quality Checker is a web-based application that allows users to check the air quality index (AQI) and pollutant levels for any location by entering its latitude and longitude. The application fetches real-time air quality data from a third-party API and displays key environmental indicators such as AQI, CO, NO₂, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, O₃, and SO₂ levels.
